# Solana OS

**Everything Solana. One place.**

Solana OS is a gateway to the Solana ecosystem: universal search, an app store,
Solana AI, wallet and portfolio, token and transaction explorers, a security
center, DeFi/RWA/payments hubs, prediction markets, news, a social feed,
extensions and a developer platform, all in one fast, dark-first interface.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Import this repository in Vercel.
2. Set **Root Directory** to `solana-os`. The framework (Next.js) is detected
   automatically.
3. Add environment variables (see `.env.example`). The only one required in
   production is `AUTH_SECRET` (`openssl rand -base64 32`). Recommended:
   `SOLANA_RPC_URL` (a private RPC) and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Solana AI).
4. Deploy.

The server is stateless: sessions are signed cookies, caches live in memory
per instance, and nothing is written to disk. That's why it runs on Vercel's
serverless functions unchanged. Solana AI streams from a route with
`maxDuration = 120`.

## Run locally

```bash
cd solana-os
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # optional
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
npm test                     # unit tests
npm run lint                 # type-check
```

## Real data, never fake data

Every response from a data provider is wrapped as `{ data, meta }`, where
`meta` names the provider and says whether the data is `live` or `demo`. The
UI shows a provenance badge on every data view and a warning banner whenever
demo data is displayed.

| Area | Provider (swappable) |
|---|---|
| Balances, transactions, mint authorities, holders, simulation | Solana JSON-RPC (`SOLANA_RPC_URL`) |
| Token search, metadata, prices, trending, audits | Jupiter Tokens API v2 / Price API v3 |
| Price charts | GeckoTerminal OHLCV |
| Protocol TVL, DEX volume, yields | DefiLlama |
| News | RSS/Atom feeds (`NEWS_FEEDS`) |
| Prediction markets | Adapter endpoint (`PREDICTION_MARKETS_URL`) |
| Solana AI | Claude (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) with tool calls into the services above |

With `DATA_MODE=auto` (default), an unreachable provider falls back to a
**demo dataset that is labelled as demo everywhere it appears**. Wallet
balances and transactions never fall back to demo data: if the RPC is down
you see an error, not invented balances. A clearly named demo wallet
(`/wallets/demo`) exists to preview the layout.

Things that need an indexer are shown as unavailable rather than estimated:
7d/30d/all-time PnL, protocol positions (lending, LP, perps), NFT metadata
and social data.

## Architecture

```
src/
  app/                 Next.js App Router pages + API routes (/api/*)
  components/          UI: shell (sidebar, ⌘K, mobile nav), domain views, charts, AI chat
  lib/
    types.ts           Domain model shared by server and client
    providers/         One module per upstream (rpc, jupiter, geckoterminal, defillama, news, demo)
    services/          Business logic composed from providers (tokens, wallets, transactions, security, ecosystem)
    solana/            Address helpers, program registry, transaction explainer, pre-sign decoder
    search/            Fuzzy scoring, natural-language intent detection, unified search engine
    ai/                Solana AI tools, Claude streaming loop, offline fallback
    auth/              Signed-cookie sessions, Sign-In With Solana, origin helper
    extensions/        Extension SDK (manifest schema, permissioned host) + catalog
    catalog/           Curated app registry and page index
    client/            Browser-side state (store), wallet/session layer, data fetching
```

- **Swapping providers:** each provider is a small module behind a service
  function. Replace `providers/jupiter.ts` with, say, Birdeye, and nothing
  else changes.
- **Search:** a static in-memory index (apps, developers, pages, extensions)
  plus federated live sources (tokens, news, markets, protocols), each with a
  small time budget. `detectIntent` routes addresses, signatures and
  natural-language questions ("what are whales buying?") to the right view or
  to Solana AI.
- **Solana AI:** a manual tool-use loop over 13 tools. Tool results are streamed
  to the client as rich cards with source links; the system prompt requires
  separating verified data, analysis and uncertainty, and forbids financial
  advice. Without an API key, an offline engine answers from the same tools
  using templates and says so.
- **Security:** token checks (mint/freeze authority, Token-2022 extensions,
  holder concentration, liquidity, age, verification), wallet/program checks
  (upgrade authority), domain checks (registry match, typosquatting, bait
  keywords) and a pre-sign decoder for serialized transactions (legacy + v0)
  that flags approvals, authority changes, account reassignment and durable
  nonces, then simulates via RPC. Results are Low/Medium/High indicators with
  explanations. Nothing is ever labelled simply "safe".
- **Wallets:** discovered through the Wallet Standard (Phantom, Solflare,
  Backpack…). Browsing never requires a wallet; any address can be watched
  read-only.
- **Auth:** email magic links (Resend), Google OAuth, and Sign-In With Solana
  (ed25519 signature verified server-side).
- **User data:** watchlist, follows, alerts, extensions, notifications and
  profile go through a `StorageAdapter` (localStorage by default), so a
  server-backed store can be added without UI changes.
- **Extensions:** manifests are validated with zod; every host capability
  (`search`, `wallet:read`, `ai`, `notifications`…) is permission-checked.
  Built-in extensions run in-process. Third-party extensions will use the same
  host API over a sandboxed iframe.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1–3 (in this build):** landing and personalized home, universal
  search, token/wallet/transaction search, App Store, Solana AI, wallet
  connection, portfolio, extensions, discover, wallet following and alerts,
  notifications, security center, news, DeFi, prediction markets, RWA,
  payments (Solana Pay requests), social feed, developer platform.
- **Next integrations:** indexer for PnL, positions and NFTs (e.g. Helius DAS
  plus webhooks for server-side alerts); a database-backed `StorageAdapter`;
  a review backend for submissions; a social backend.
- **Phase 4:** execution layer (swaps and payments signed in-wallet), sandboxed
  third-party extensions, AI actions, ecosystem marketplace.
